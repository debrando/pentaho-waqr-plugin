# pentaho-waqr-plugin

Unofficial source clone of [Pentaho WAQR plugin](svn://source.pentaho.org/svnroot/platform-plugins/waqr-plugin), a legacy community tool to keep alive on 5.X reports made with the deprecated and unsupported [Pentaho Web-based Ad Hoc Query and Reporting](http://community.pentaho.com/faq/waqr_faq.php).

The binary on the [official marketplace](http://www.pentaho.com/marketplace/) are still builded and uploaded with [Pentaho Continuous Integration](http://ci.pentaho.com/job/WAQR-Plugin/) from sources on the original [SVN repository](svn://source.pentaho.org/svnroot/platform-plugins/waqr-plugin).
